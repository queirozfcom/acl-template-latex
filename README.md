# acl-template-latex

Simple template for ACL papers.

Using a slightly modified version of natbib (the modified library is `plainnatsimple.bst`, the original is `plainnat.bst`).

- full-width tables with custom column width

- images

- `plainnat` was modified to supress more than 3 authors and not show too many fields (such as address) in the references.
